The below charts display the year of birth for cows on the same farm having the same SE-number. In Swedish livestock farming unique IDs are created by combining the official Herd ID (a pseudonym of this is stored as FarmName_Pseudo in Gigacow data), a four digit code and the birth year of the cow. The four digit code is the ear tag number of a cow assigned at birth and a code may not be reused within 3 years after a cow leaves the farm. In formal records the four digit code is followed by a dash and a control number generated from the four digit code to ensure it has been properly entered into systems, this is omitted in Gigacow because of the control number not being entered in the DelPro herd management system on many farms.

The below plots show the cases and time between occurances for SE-numbers being repeated in Gigacow herds. Overall the combination of FarmName_Pseudo, SE_Number and Birth year provide unique identification of animals in Gigacow.

- Kokontrollen contain `r length(unique(Kok_SameID_rowwise$BirthID))` SE-numbers being reused out of which `r length(unique(dup_Kok$BirthID))` are duplicates within an illegal time frame.\
- Nav contain `r length(unique(Nav_SameID_rowwise$BirthID))` SE-numbers being reused out of which `r length(unique(dup_Nav$BirthID))` are duplicates within an illegal time frame.\
- DelPro data has proven more problematic with erroneous entries and alternative ID numbers (Animal Numbers) making it difficult to uniquely identify Cows. There are currently `r length(unique(dup_Del$SE_Number))` cows with "split" identities due to being entered with two separate Animal numbers in their DelPro herd management system. Erroneous entries where two cows (separated by birth date) are assigned the same SE-number are also possible. Currently The SE-number(s) `r unique(dup_Del_Cows$SE_Number)` are affected by this and the entries in the DelPro Cow table displayed below\
<br>
```{r Showing problematic cows in DelPro, echo=FALSE, results= 'asis'}
kable(dup_Del_Cows)
```
<br>
The Cows collected in SLU Gigacow can be divided into four categories where each cow participate in one or more categories:\
- Cows with data collected in the DelPro Herd management system.\
- Cows with data collected in the DelPro Herd management system and milked during the time Gigacow has been collecting data.\
- Cows with data collected from Kokontrollen.\
- Cows with data collected from NAV.\
<br>

There is not a complete overlap between these datasets. Some calves born on Gigacow farms will never be recruited into dairy production on a Gigacow farms and all three data sources contain old records. A current priority is to ensure that as many currently milked cows as possible are accompanied not only with DelPro data but also Kokontrollen and Nav. 
```{r Dataset overlapsDelPro duplicates, echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

# Select rows from DF.Del_Cow where SE_Number exists in DF.Del_Cow_Milked

Looking in detail at the data available on a per farm level it is clear that some farms are lacking coverage from Kokontrollen and Nav.
